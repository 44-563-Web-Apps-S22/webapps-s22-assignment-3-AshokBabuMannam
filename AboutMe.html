        <h4>Pushpa</h4>
        <p>Pushpa Raj is a coolie who works to smuggle red sanders, a rare wood that only grows in the Seshachalam Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. When DSP Govindappa raids them in the forest, Pushpa hides and recovers the stock, thereby gaining the trust of his employer Konda Reddy. With the help of novel ideas to smuggle the red sanders, he quickly rises through the ranks and becomes Konda Reddy's partner.<br>
           Mangalam Srinu, a merciless dealer who manages the red sanders syndicate entrusts Konda Reddy to keep 200 tons of his stock safe. As Konda's younger brother, Jolly Reddy is deemed incompetent, Pushpa is given the job. Govindappa attempts to raid them but Pushpa throws all the logs into the river, saving it from being seized. At a party, Pushpa overhears that Srinu is selling the wood at a much higher rate than what they're paid. He asks Konda to demand a fair share but backs down as going against Srinu seems risky.
